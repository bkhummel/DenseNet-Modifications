# DenseNet-Modifications
Final Project for Image Processing. 

Used cmasch's implementation of the DenseNet, found here: https://github.com/cmasch/densenet/blob/master/densenet.py
Original paper for the DenseNet found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993

Implemented an ensemble of simplified DenseNets and tested their performace, comparing it to the original architecture.
This model uses three DenseNets, each with 1 dense-block and 5 densely connected convolutional layers.
